                Then Jesus took a cup, gave thanks to God, and said, " Take this and share it among yourselves. I tell you that from now on I will not drink this wine until the Kingdom of God comes. " Then he took a piece of bread, gave thanks to God, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, " This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in memory of me. " In the same way, he gave them the cup after the supper, saying, " This cup is God's new convenant sealed with my blood, which is poured out for you..." (Luke 22:17-20)
                The Holy Eucharist was Jesus' gift to us before He ascended into heaven. The Eucharist is a way that leads us to heaven, many miracles have been attached to its veneration. This page will give you a deep insight of how the Eucharist is the true body and blood of Christ, through the various miracles It has done.

                Then a great an mysterious sight appeared in the sky. There was a woman, whose dress was the sun and who had the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. (Revelation 12:1). Then she gave birth to a son, who will rule over all nations with an iron rod. (Revelation 12:5). Who is this woman, this woman that prophets of old told us about. Indeed, She is the Blessed Virgin Mary. She was with Jesus every step of the way; during His birth, His public ministry, His death and Glorious ressurection.
                She was the one who led the servants at the wedding in Cana when they had no wine.  She visits us, via Her apparitions to warn us, and also to guide us towards Her son, Jesus and Heaven. This page is dedicated entirely to Her.

                Weekly Bible Verses
            </h2>
            <p class="signup-text">
                The Devil said to him, " If you are God's Son, order this stone to turn into bread." But Jesus answered, " The scripture says, ' Man cannot live on bread alone.'" Then the Devil took him up and showed him in a second all the kingdoms of the world. " I will give you all this power and all this wealth," the Devil told him. "It has all been handed over to me, and I can give it to anyone I choose. All this will be yours, then, if you worship me."
                Jesus answered, " The scripture says, 'Worship the Lord your God and serve only him!'" Then the Devil took him to Jerusalem and set him on the highest point of the Temple, and said to him, " If you are God's Son, throw yourself down from here. For the scripture says, ' They will hold you upmwith their hands so that not even your feet will be hurt on the stones. '" But Jesus answered, " The scripture says, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'". (Luke 4:3-12).
                During Jesus' temptation by the Devil, he conquered the Devil with the scripture (verses from the Holy Bible). In the same way, Jesus urges us to do the same, utilizing the Bible verses that will be cited out in this page.

            <p class="signup-text">
                Jesus Christ came down in human form to purchase us with His blood. He made us kings and prophets and a chosen people. Satan tries daily to see if he can get our souls, becuase he knows what will become of him and all his followers on the last day. Christ always urges us to make Him our number 1 priority in anything we do. This page is dedicated entirely to show you how you can sieze your days ahead from satan, with the help of Jesus and His Blessed Mother, Mary.

                Prayers
            </h2>
            <p class="signup-text">
                " Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples." Jesus said to them, " When you pray, say this: ' Father: May your holy name be honoured; may your Kingdom come. Give us day by day the food we need. Forgive us our sins, for we forgive everyone who does us wrong. And do not bring us to hard testing '". (Luke 11:1-4) Jesus shows us in the scriptures that prayer is the only way we can connect with Him and heaven. We should always pray from our hearts and with faith, and see the goodness of God. This page is dedicated entirely to short prayers we can say, and also links to different prayer groups across the world.

                Bible Reflections
            </h2>
            <p class="signup-text">
                Before the world was created, the Word already existed; he was with God, and he was the same God. From the very beginning the Word was with God. Through him God made all things; not one thing in all creation was made without him. The Word was the source of life, and this life brought light to mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness never put it out. (John 1:1-5). Jesus is the Word, if we meditate on Him, we know Him better. This page is dedicated entirely to the preaching of the word of God.
